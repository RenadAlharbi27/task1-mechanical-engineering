### Task 1: Designing a Door Hinge

#### Part:  
I chose to design a **door hinge**, a commonly used component for doors and cabinets to enable smooth rotational movement.  

#### Tools Used in the Design:
1. **Extrude Add**: To create the side plates of the hinge (flat components).  
2. **Extrude Remove**: To create the screw holes in the plates for mounting.  
3. **Revolve**: To design the central cylindrical pin of the hinge.  
4. **Fillet**: To smooth the edges for a realistic and polished look.  

#### Benefits of the Part:
- Facilitates the smooth opening and closing of doors or windows.  
- Designed to endure daily use and repeated pressure.

### Task 2: Designing a Coffee Cup

#### Selected Object:  
I designed a **coffee cup** based on a real-life object as inspiration. A coffee cup is an essential everyday item and a fun choice for showcasing 3D modeling techniques.

#### Tools Used in the Design:
1. **Revolve**: To create the cupâ€™s base shape by revolving a profile.  
2. **Shell**: To hollow out the interior and create the walls.  
3. **Sweep**: To design the handle by sweeping a circular profile along a curved path.  
4. **Fillet**: To smooth the edges of the handle and rim for comfort and usability.  

#### Measuring Tools:
- **Digital Caliper** (as shown in the first image): Used to measure:  
  - The diameter and height of the cup.  
  - The thickness of the handle.  

**Design Link**:
